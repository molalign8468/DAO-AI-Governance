**DAO AI Governance** is a cutting-edge **Web3 platform** that combines **decentralized governance** with **AI-powered decision-making**. It allows DAOs to **create, vote, delegate, and execute proposals** while leveraging **AI-driven insights** to evaluate proposal risks, ROI predictions, and actionable recommendations.

This project demonstrates how **blockchain and AI can work together** to create **transparent, intelligent, and efficient decentralized communities**.

## üåê Live Demo

- **Demo URL:** [https://your-dapp-demo.com](https://your-dapp-demo.com)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The demo and all smart contracts are deployed **only on the Holesky testnet**. No mainnet ETH is used for demo now.  
  > Users can get test ETH from the **Holesky faucet** here: [Holesky Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky)  
  > This allows safe testing and interaction with the DAO platform.
  > For other network you can deploy as you want.

## ‚ö° Key Features

### Web3 & Smart Contracts

- Proposal lifecycle: **Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Succeeded ‚Üí Queued ‚Üí Executed**.
- Voting using **ERC-20 governance tokens**.
- Multi-signature treasury management for secure fund execution.
- State-aware proposal management: queue, execute, and track proposals.
- **Upgradable Contracts:** All smart contracts can be upgraded safely without losing state.

### AI-Powered Insights

- **Proposal Summarization:** Condenses long proposals into concise, neutral summaries.
- **Risk Analysis:** AI generates a **risk score** (0-100) for each proposal.
- **ROI Prediction:** Estimates potential returns for treasury allocations.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Approve, reject, or defer proposals.
- **Justification:** AI provides detailed reasoning for its insights.

### Frontend (React + Tailwind)

- Real-time DAO stats: treasury balance, total supply, proposals, and voting power.
- Tab-based proposal views: **Details**, **Votes**, **AI Insights**, **Execution**.
- Responsive and interactive UI with animated backgrounds and smooth transitions.

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

- REST API endpoints:
  - `/ai/summarize` ‚Üí Generates AI summaries.
  - `/ai/insights` ‚Üí Returns AI-driven proposal insights.
- Integrates **Google Gemini AI** for intelligent analysis.
- Handles input validation, error management, and JSON parsing for AI responses.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Proposal Submission**  
   User submits a proposal with description, requested ETH, and recipient address.
2. **AI Summarization**
   - Generates a concise, neutral summary.
   - Highlights purpose and requested funds.
3. **AI Insights Generation**
   - Provides **risk score** and **ROI prediction**.
   - Recommends **Approve/Reject** with justification.
4. **Voting**
   - Users vote directly or with AI insights.
   - DAO contract verifies votes via Token contract.
5. **Proposal Execution**
   - Approved proposals are queued in **Timelock**.
   - After delay, **Treasury** executes ETH transfer to recipient.
6. **User Feedback**
   - Users see proposal & execution status in real-time.

---

## üöÄ Roadmap

- Multi-language AI support.
- Layer 2 integration for cheaper gas fees.
- AI-powered prediction of proposal outcomes.
- NFT-based voting rights.
- Security audits for smart contracts.
- Continuous improvement of upgradable contracts.

---

## üîí Security & Upgradability

- All smart contracts are **upgradable via OpenZeppelin proxies**, allowing safe enhancements while preserving state.
- Proposal execution and treasury operations are **timelocked for added security**.
- Follows **OpenZeppelin best practices** for proxy-based upgrades.
- Planned **audit before mainnet deployment**..

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Are the smart contracts upgradeable?</summary>
  <p>Yes, all contracts (DAO, Token, Timelock, Treasury) are designed to be upgradeable via proxy contracts for safe enhancements.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can users vote without AI insights?</summary>
  <p>Yes, voting can be done directly on-chain without requesting AI insights.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What happens if a proposal fails?</summary>
  <p>Failed proposals are recorded on-chain but are not executed; treasury funds remain safe.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does Timelock work?</summary>
  <p>Approved proposals are queued in the Timelock contract for a set delay. This prevents instant execution and allows review before funds are released.</p>
</details>
